# Competition Rules

## Core Rules

1. The TT must **not** use LLMs for the actual translations.
2. You **may** use LLMs to help build the TT itself.
3. You may use the unit tests to verify correctness of the translated code.
4. The team should add a half page to explain their architectural choices.
5. The TT core (`tt/`) must contain **no project-specific mappings** (e.g. no hard-coded `@ghostfolio/…` import paths). Project-specific configuration belongs in `tt_import_map.json` inside the relevant scaffold directory, passed to the translator at call time.
6. TT must not have project-specific logic which it simply copies into the translation. The translated code must be actually translated code, not pregenerated logic.
7. You may use AST libraries.

## Scaffold Rules

8. You are not allowed to add anything to `translations/ghostfolio_pytx_example/` before running `tt`.
9. You are allowed to copy the scaffold from `translations/ghostfolio_pytx_example/`, and use as a wrapper for the translation.
10. The scaffold (`tt/tt/scaffold/`) provides HTTP wiring only — not domain calculations. It may contain:
    - FastAPI endpoint handlers
    - In-memory state management (UserState)
    - Auth helpers (`_make_tokens`, `_get_user`)
    - A thin delegation layer (`_try_calculator`) that calls the translated calculator
    - Support modules (type stubs, date-fns/lodash equivalents, model definitions)
11. The scaffold must **not** contain:
    - Financial arithmetic (cost-basis tracking, performance calculation, chart generation)
    - Private helper functions beyond `_make_tokens`, `_get_user`, and `_try_calculator`
    - Nested loops that process activities or market data (beyond the delegation layer)

## What the Translated Code Must Provide

The translated calculator must implement the interface defined in:
`translations/ghostfolio_pytx_example/PORTFOLIO_CALCULATOR_INTERFACE.md`

Key requirement: `RoaiPortfolioCalculator.get_symbol_metrics()` must return a dict with at least `total_investment`, `gross_performance`, `current_values`, and related fields.

## Automated Rule Checks

Run `make detect_rule_breaches` to verify compliance. The following checks are enforced:

| Check | What it detects |
|-------|-----------------|
| `detect_llm_usage` | LLM API imports/calls in `tt/` |
| `detect_direct_mappings` | Project-specific import paths in `tt/` core |
| `detect_explicit_implementation` | Domain logic in `tt/` (function size, domain identifiers, string comparisons) |
| `detect_explicit_financial_logic` | Financial arithmetic, variables, and nested loops in scaffold |
| `detect_scaffold_bloat` | Private helpers beyond the allowed set in scaffold `main.py` |
| `detect_code_block_copying` | 10+ line blocks from `tt/` appearing verbatim in translated output |



## Judging Criteria

The TT will be judged on:

1. **Rule compliance** — the translation tool must not break the rules above.
2. **Correctness** — translated Python code passes the API tests of the reference projects, and how many of them.
3. **Python code quality**, ranked by relevance:
   1. Simplicity as Discipline
   2. Testing & Verification
   3. Elegance & Readability
   4. Iterative Delivery
   5. Humility & Scope Limits
   6. Long-term Sustainability
   7. Data Structures First
   8. Customer-First Thinking
   9. Avoid Duplication (DRY)
   10. Understand the Metal
4. **Understanding** — judges will evaluate how well competitors understand what their translator actually does. Automated scoring will be balanced with human evaluation of architectural choices, trade-offs, and the team's ability to explain their approach. A high test score from a tool the team cannot explain will be weighted down.

We use tools like pyscn for scoring the quality. Scoring: `make evaluate_tt` runs tests (50%) + code quality via pyscn (50%). Judge review adjusts the final score.
